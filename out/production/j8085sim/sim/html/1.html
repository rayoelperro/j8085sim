	Please keep these points in mind while entering the instruction code:<br>

<p>1.The Opcode, Operand-1 and Operand-2 must be separated from each other using space or comma. 
<p>2.A line should contain only a single instruction.
<p>3.Redundant spaces and commas in instructions are neglected. 
<p>4.Instructions are not case sensitive.
<p>5.If not specified, the instructions are loaded at location 0000.
<p>6.If not specified, execution starts from location 0000.
<p>7.By default, Stack Pointer is FFFF.
<p>8.Labels: Label names should end with a colon. There should NOT be a space between label name and colon. 
<br>Eg: <br>
LABEL1: MOV A,B
<p>9.Comments: Comments should be preceded by a semicolon. Everything that comes after a semicolon till the end of the line is regarded as a comment. 
In cases where an instruction has two operands, everything that comes after the second operand is regarded as a comment. But still it is a good practice to use semicolon to start a comment.
<br>Eg:
<br>ADD C ;This is a comment
<p>10.Some Assembler Directives can be used in this software. These directives MUST begin with a '@' symbol. The Assembler Directives supported are - @NEXT, @BEGIN and @EQU.</P>
