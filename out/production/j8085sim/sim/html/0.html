<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>What is an 8085 Simulator ?</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>		Simulator IDE is a powerful application that supplies 8085 educators and developers with user-friendly graphical development environment for different OSes with integrated simulator (emulator), Basic compiler, assembler for Intel 8085 8-bit microprocessor.
</P>
<p>The simulator is a perfect working and interactive software for those who can’t afford to buy the 8085 hardware kit. 
The software simulates the exact working of the kit with some additional software enhancements.
The system requires only the Java Virtual Machine for executing the software.
The code is written in simple 8085 mnemonics. The user need not worry about the address of instructions.
The name of a label can be used instead of an address. 
As the software is developed in Java, it requires very little memory space and is very fast in execution.
The compiler points out any errors in operands or in the syntax of the statement. </p>
<p>The user provides mnemonic code, which is then compiled. The instructions are checked for any syntactical errors and invalid mnemonics. 
The user is informed with the list of errors (if any) along with the line numbers. If the compilation is error free and successful, 
the corresponding hexadecimal representation of the instruction are generated and added to memory. 

 	In this software, inorder to free the user from various overheads associated with running invalid code, the compilation of the program 
 	takes place at several stages -
 	<br>1 – The program is compiled while the user enters it.
 	<br>2 – User can manually compile, using Compile button.
 	<br>3 – The program is compiled before execution.

 	<br>The execution makes the necessary changes in the registers, flags, I/O ports and the 8085 memory addresses. The software also provides 
 	facilities for Interrupts.</p>
